The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package and the Munich Spin-Polarized Relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker use of different approaches to calculate the energy ground state of a structure. Even without an ionic relaxation is still important to perform an electronic relaxation before we calculate some of its properties such as its exchangeâ€“correlation energies. Beyond that, we can compare the results obtained with each program and compare to the well know experimental properties of the structure.Thus, variations of 1\% over [Keshavarz et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.07.298) structural parameters were applied in a narrow range. Since we have the experimental data, it is of good sense to get some of those informations by first-principle calculations. In that sense, structural optimizations of D0$_{19}$ Fe$_{2}$MnGe were performed both with VASP and SPR-KKR.

Structural optimizations with (a) SPR-KKR with LDA (b) SPR-KKR with GGA (c) VASP with LDA (d) VASP with GGA

The figure shows SPR-KKR structural parameters optimization above and VASP below. At left, optimizations were made using LDA and at right using GGA. With SPR-KKR no energy minimum was found, however with VASP absolute minimums were found to (0.86,1.00) and (0.96,1.00) with LDA and GGA, respectively. While c/a is approximately equal to the experimental one reported by [Keshavarz et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.07.298), volume is too far away from it in the LDA case. Therefore, the optimized volumes are V$^{GGA}$=96.1\AA$^{3}$ and V$^{LDA}$=86.1 \AA$^{3}$.
