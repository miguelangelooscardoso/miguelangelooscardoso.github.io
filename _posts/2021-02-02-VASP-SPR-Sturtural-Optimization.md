The previous subsection helped us to construct a solid base to perform our final calculations. However, we should note that all further results have now a slightly difference on the calculation of the integration mesh. The Wigner-Seitz radius is now set to be equal for each atom. All the computational evaluations previously made are considered. Variations of 1\% over Keshavarz et al. \cite{KESHAVARZ2019793} structural parameters were applied in a narrow range. Since we have the experimental data, it is of good sense to get some of those informations by first-principle calculations. In that sense, structural optimizations of D0$_{19}$ Fe$_{2}$MnGe were performed both with VASP and SPR-KKR.

Figure \ref{KKR_VASP} shows SPR-KKR structural parameters optimization above and VASP below. At left, optimizations were made using LDA and at right using GGA. With SPR-KKR no energy minimum was found, however with VASP absolute minimums were found to (0.86,1.00) and (0.96,1.00) with LDA and GGA, respectively. While c/a is approximately equal to the experimental one reported by Keshavarz et al. \cite{KESHAVARZ2019793}, volume is too far away from it in the LDA case. Therefore, the optimized volumes are V$^{GGA}$=96.1\AA$^{3}$ and V$^{LDA}$=86.1 \AA$^{3}$. A major effort was made to reach a minimum value with GGA using SPR-KKR.
