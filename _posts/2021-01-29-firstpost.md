An energy and a magnetic moment variation per atom of $$10^4$$ (0.1 meV) and $$10^2$$ (0.01
B) is acceptable for our purposes here. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 help us to select the mesh sizes
and cut-o energies desired. Then, gure 3.3 conrms that those values respect our criteria
for magnetic moment variations. As seen in table 3.1, exchange correlation functionals display
an important role on structural and magnetic properties. Figure 3.4 shows a result from a
fast calculation performed with a mesh grid 5  5  5 and a cut-o energy of 350 eV.
