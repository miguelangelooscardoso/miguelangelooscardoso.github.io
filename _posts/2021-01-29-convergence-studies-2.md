Experimentally it is known how those metals are ordered, however it is of good sense to confirm it. Figure 3.7 shows the optimization of the lattice considering three of the most common crystal structures: body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic and hexagonal close- packed. As expected bcc Fe, fcc Ni and hcp Co are the most stable crystal systems.

Another thing worth verifying is their ferromagnetism. Therefore, figure 3.8 shows us that those metals are confirmed experimentally to be ferromagnets (FM). Antiferromagnetic (AFM) and non-magnetic (NM) configurations seems to be less stable.
